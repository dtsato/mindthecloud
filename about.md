The future is in the cloud. Or at least a part of it.

Hello, I'm Rafael Rosa, I've been working with IT since the last milenium (1995) and since 2009 I've been working in the hosting and cloud industry.

Even though I started as a software developer, the wind changed and led me to work in product related roles, most of the time working on public IaaS products as product manager. I've also participate in software communities, talk at events, [co-host a podcast for developers in Portuguese](http://grokpodcast.com) and advise decision makers regarding the cloud market.

Since moving to the dark side I've been watching the industry and related fields to figure out what's coming ahead, and this involves gathering a lot of info (reading, listening, going to events and community meetups, coding) and coming up with educated guesses about the future. I'm planning to share some of these opinions on this site and perhaps record some podcasts along the way.

Right now I live in Montreal/Canada, but I'm originaly from SÃ£o Paulo/Brazil, where I work at [eNovance](http://enovance.com), a company specialized in [OpenStack](http://openstack.org), acquired by Red Hat in June 2014.

I hope you enjoy the content, feedback is welcome, trolling is not tolerated.
